This is a team ETL project focused on the death rates during COVID-19. For this project we identified two datasets, sourced from [Kaggle] (_) and [OWID] (_). We combined these datasets to create comparative data over a two year period (2020-2022) from different countries.

## <a id="limitations-header">Data Limitations
Although our investigation was very interesting, and the data we have acquired is regularly updated with and its findings are **"true"**, it is important to note that they do not **"tell the entire story".** It is also worth noting that data gathered during covid cannot be used with absolute certainity of reliability.

 Extract, Transform & Load
 
 **Extract** ðŸ“‚
We started by extracting the two CSV files and examining them separately to see what we were working with.

**Transform** ðŸ§¹

We dropped many of the columns that were not relevant to our project, then we renamed the column heads in both DataFrames to that we could concatanate the two DataFrames:

To estimate the period of the combined dataset, we decided the common start and end dates for countries between datasets 
We were careful not to mistakenly suggest a country has low deaths/cases when they have provided less data than others

We also created a visualisation to display the spread of data over time

change 'newstartdate' to 'newdate' to allow merge on this variable with the OWID dataset
